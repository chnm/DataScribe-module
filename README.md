# DataScribe

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for the transcription of structured data.

When cloning this repository remember to rename the directory from "Datascribe-module" to "Datascribe".

A user manual is available [in the wiki for this GitHub repository](https://github.com/chnm/Datascribe-module/wiki). 

Note: in order to be able to export datasets, the directory `/files/asset` in your Omeka S installation must be writable by the system.
